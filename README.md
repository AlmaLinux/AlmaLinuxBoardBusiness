# AlmaLinuxBoardBusiness

This repo is setup to allow the community to ask for information and/or make requests of the [AlmaLinux OS Foundation Board](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Transparency.html#we-strive-to-be-transparent).

To ask a question, make a comment or bring anything to the Board's attention, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/AlmaLinuxBoardBusiness/issues/new/choose).

Board members will attempt to respond on a best-effort basis, and bring up any relevant questions/topics during the [meetings of the board of directors](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Transparency.html#minutes-of-almalinux-os-foundation-board-meetings).
